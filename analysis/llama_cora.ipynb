      "Abstract: This paper highlights the role of mathematical programming, particularly linear programming, in training neural networks. A neural network description is given in terms of separating planes in the input space that suggests the use of linear programming for determining these planes. A more standard description in terms of a mean square error in the output space is also given, which leads to the use of unconstrained minimization techniques for training a neural network. The linear programming approach is demonstrated by a brief description of a system for breast cancer diagnosis that has been in use for the last four years at a major medical facility., \n",

The unifying theme underlying our work is the use of example-based learning methods for both analyzing and synthesizing face images. We label the example face images (and for the problem of face detection, \"near miss\" faces as well) with descriptive parameters for pose, expression, identity, and face vs. non-face. Then, by using example-based learning techniques, we develop networks for performing analysis tasks such as pose and expression estimation, face recognition, and face detection in cluttered scenes. In addition to these analysis applications, we show how the example-based technique can also be used as a novel method for image synthesis that is for computer graphics. , \n",

      "Abstract: In time series problems, noise can be divided into two categories: dynamic noise which drives the process, and observational noise which is added in the measurement process, but does not influence future values of the system. In this framework, empirical volatilities (the squared relative returns of prices) exhibit a significant amount of observational noise. To model and predict their time evolution adequately, we estimate state space models that explicitly include observational noise. We obtain relaxation times for shocks in the logarithm of volatility ranging from three weeks (for foreign exchange) to three to five months (for stock indices). In most cases, a two-dimensional hidden state is required to yield residuals that are consistent with white noise. We compare these results with ordinary autoregressive models (without a hidden state) and find that autoregressive models underestimate the relaxation times by about two orders of magnitude due to their ignoring the distinction between observational and dynamic noise. This new interpretation of the dynamics of volatility in terms of relaxators in a state space model carries over to stochastic volatility models and to GARCH models, and is useful for several problems in finance, including risk management and the pricing of derivative securities. \n",

      "Abstract: Previous neural network learning algorithms for sequence processing are computationally expensive and perform poorly when it comes to long time lags. This paper first introduces a simple principle for reducing the descriptions of event sequences without loss of information. A consequence of this principle is that only unexpected inputs can be relevant. This insight leads to the construction of neural architectures that learn to `divide and conquer' by recursively decomposing sequences. I describe two architectures. The first functions as a self-organizing multi-level hierarchy of recurrent networks. The second, involving only two recurrent networks, tries to collapse a multi-level predictor hierarchy into a single recurrent net. Experiments show that the system can require less computation per time step and many fewer training sequences than conventional training algorithms for recurrent nets., \n",

Bottom-up segmentation heuristics often fail when neighboring digits overlap substantially. We describe a system that has a stochastic generative model of each digit class and we show that this is the only knowledge required for segmentation. The system uses Gibbs sampling to construct a perceptual interpretation of a digit string and segmentation arises naturally from the \"explaining away\" effects that occur during Bayesian inference. By using conditional mixtures of factor analyzers, it is possible to extract an explicit, compact representation of the instantiation parameters that describe the pose of each digit. These instantiation parameters can then be used as the inputs to a higher level system that models the relationships between digits. The same technique could be used to model individual digits as redundancies between the instantiation parameters of their parts., \n",

      "Abstract: Researchers in the field of Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) have been developing efficient mechanisms to coordinate the activities of multiple autonomous agents. The need for coordination arises because agents have to share resources and expertise required to achieve their goals. Previous work in the area includes using sophisticated information exchange protocols, investigating heuristics for negotiation, and developing formal models of possibilities of conflict and cooperation among agent interests. In order to handle the changing requirements of continuous and dynamic environments, we propose learning as a means to provide additional possibilities for effective coordination. We use reinforcement learning techniques on a block pushing problem to show that agents can learn complimentary policies to follow a desired path without any knowledge about each other. We theoretically analyze and experimentally verify the effects of learning rate on system convergence, and demonstrate benefits of using learned coordination knowledge on similar problems. Reinforcement learning based coordination can be achieved in both cooperative and non-cooperative domains, and in domains with noisy communication channels and other stochastic characteristics that present a formidable challenge to using other coordination schemes. \n",

Incremental evolution is an approach through which a dynamic evaluation function is scaled over time in order to improve the performance of evolutionary optimization.

Using two domains, a two-agent pursuit-evasion game and the Tracker [6] trail-following task, we demonstrate that incremental evolution is most successful when applied near the beginning of an evolutionary run. We also show that incremental evolution can be successful when the intermediate evaluation functions are more difficult than the target evaluation function, as well as when they are easier than the target function. , \n",

Currently the most important application of these methods is to temporal credit assignment in reinforcement learning. Well known reinforcement learning algorithms, such as AHC or Q-learning, may be viewed as instances of TD learning. This paper examines the issues of the efficient and general implementation of TD() for arbitrary , for use with reinforcement learning algorithms optimizing the discounted sum of rewards. The traditional approach, based on eligibility traces, is argued to suffer from both inefficiency and lack of generality. The TTD (Truncated Temporal Differences) procedure is proposed as an alternative, that indeed only approximates TD(), but requires very little computation per action and can be used with arbitrary function representation methods. The idea from which it is derived is fairly simple and not new, but probably unexplored so far. Encouraging experimental results are presented, suggesting that using &gt; 0 with the TTD procedure allows one to obtain a significant learning speedup at essentially the same cost as usual TD(0) learning.\n",

Recently, other sequential decision-making problems have been studied prompting the development of new algorithms and analyses. We describe a new generalized model that subsumes mdps as well as many of the recent variations. We prove some basic results concerning this model and develop generalizations of value iteration, policy iteration, model-based reinforcement-learning, and Q-learning that can be used to make optimal decisions in the generalized model under various assumptions. Applications of the theory to particular models are described, including risk-averse mdps, exploration-sensitive mdps, sarsa, Q-learning with spreading, two-player games, and approximate max picking via sampling. Central to the results are the contraction property of the value operator and a stochastic-approximation theorem that reduces asynchronous convergence to synchronous convergence. , \n",

A Frank-Wolfe-type algorithm is proposed for the penalty problem that terminates at a stationary point or a global solution. Novel aspects of the approach include: (i) A linear complementarity formulation of the step function that \"counts\" misclassifications, (ii) Exact penalty formulation without boundedness, nondegeneracy or constraint qualification assumptions, (iii) An exact solution extraction from the sequence of minimizers of the penalty function for a finite value of the penalty parameter for the general LPEC and an explicitly exact solution for the LPEC with uncoupled constraints, and (iv) A parametric quadratic programming formulation of the LPEC associated with the misclassification minimization problem.\n",

      "Abstract: It is open as to which chromosomal dimension performs best. Although higher-dimensional encodings (whether real or imaginary) can preserve more geographical gene linkages, we suspect that too high a dimension would not perform desirably. We are studying the question of which dimension of encoding is best for a given instance. It is likely that the optimal dimension is somehow dependent on the chromosome size and the input graph topology; interactions with the flexibility of crossover are yet unknown. The interaction of these considerations with the number of cuts used in the crossover is also an open issue. * In relocating genes onto a multi-dimensional chromosome, the simplest way is via a sequential assignment such as row-major order. Section 4 showed that performance improves when a DFS-row-major reembedding is used for two- and three-dimensional encodings. We suspect that this phenomenon will be consistent for higher-dimensional cases, and hope to perform more detailed investigations in the future. Although DFS reordering proved to be helpful for both linear encodings [19] and multi-dimensional encodings, we do not believe DFS-row-major reembedding is a good approach for the multi-dimensional cases since the row-major embedding is so simplistic. We are considering alternative 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional reembeddings which will hopefully provide further improvement. [4] T. N. Bui and B. R. Moon.

Mechanisms that automatically compile neural networks into symbolic rules offer a promising perspective to overcome this practical shortcoming of neural network representations. This paper describes an approach to neural network rule extraction based on Validity Interval Analysis (VI-Analysis). VI-Analysis is a generic tool for extracting symbolic knowledge from Backpropagation-style artificial neural networks. It does this by propagating whole intervals of activations through the network in both the forward and backward directions. In the context of rule extraction, these intervals are used to prove or disprove the correctness of conjectured rules. We describe techniques for generating and testing rule hypotheses, and demonstrate these using some simple classification tasks including the MONK's benchmark problems. Rules extracted by VI-Analysis are provably correct. No assumptions are made about the topology of the network at hand, as well as the procedure employed for training the network. \n",

Abstract The task of discovering interesting regularities in (large) sets of data (data mining, knowledge discovery) has recently met with increased interest in Machine Learning in general and in Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) in particular. However, while there is a widely accepted definition for the task of concept learning from examples in ILP, definitions for the data mining task have been proposed only recently. In this paper, we examine these so-called \"non-monotonic semantics\" definitions and show that non-monotonicity is only an incidental property of the data mining learning task, and that this task makes perfect sense without such an assumption. We therefore introduce and define a generalized definition of the data mining task called the ILP description learning problem and discuss its properties and relation to the traditional concept learning (prediction) learning problem. Since our characterization is entirely on the level of models, the definition applies independently of the chosen hypothesis language.\n",

      "Abstract: We had previously shown that regularization principles lead to approximation schemes which are equivalent to networks with one layer of hidden units, called Regularization Networks. In particular, standard smoothness functionals lead to a subclass of regularization networks, the well known Radial Basis Functions approximation schemes. This paper shows that regularization networks encompass a much broader range of approximation schemes, including many of the popular general additive models and some of the neural networks. In particular, we introduce new classes of smoothness functionals that lead to different classes of basis functions. Additive splines as well as some tensor product splines can be obtained from appropriate classes of smoothness functionals. Furthermore, the same generalization that extends Radial Basis Functions (RBF) to Hyper Basis Functions (HBF) also leads from additive models to ridge approximation models, containing as special cases Breiman's hinge functions, some forms of Projection Pursuit Regression and several types of neural networks. We propose to use the term Generalized Regularization Networks for this broad class of approximation schemes that follow from an extension of regularization. In the probabilistic interpretation of regularization, the different classes of basis functions correspond to different classes of prior probabilities on the approximating function spaces, and therefore to different types of smoothness assumptions. In summary, different multilayer networks with one hidden layer, which we collectively call Generalized Regularization Networks, correspond to different classes of priors and associated smoothness functionals in a classical regularization principle. Three broad classes are a) Radial Basis Functions that can be generalized to Hyper Basis Functions, b) some tensor product splines, and c) additive splines that can be generalized to schemes of the type of ridge approximation, hinge functions and several perceptron-like neural networks with one-hidden layer. 1 This paper will appear on Neural Computation, vol. 7, pages 219-269, 1995.

      "Abstract: Genetic programming is distinguished from other evolutionary algorithms in that it uses tree representations of variable size instead of linear strings of fixed length. The flexible representation scheme is very important because it allows the underlying structure of the data to be discovered automatically. One primary difficulty, however, is that the solutions may grow too big without any improvement of their generalization ability. In this paper we investigate the fundamental relationship between the performance and complexity of the evolved structures. The essence of the parsimony problem is demonstrated empirically by analyzing error landscapes of programs evolved for neural network synthesis. We consider genetic programming as a statistical inference problem and apply the Bayesian model-comparison framework to introduce a class of fitness functions with error and complexity terms. An adaptive learning method is then presented that automatically balances the model-complexity factor to evolve parsimonious programs without losing the diversity of the population needed for achieving the desired training accuracy. The effectiveness of this approach is empirically shown on the induction of sigma-pi neural networks for solving a real-world medical diagnosis problem as well as benchmark tasks. \n",

It is standard to use a stepwise procedure guided by a series of significance tests to select a single model, and then to make inference conditionally on the selected model. However, this ignores model uncertainty, which can be substantial. We review the standard Bayesian model averaging solution to this problem and extend it to survival analysis, introducing partial Bayes factors to do so for the Cox proportional hazards model. In two examples, taking account of model uncertainty enhances predictive performance, to an extent that could be clinically useful.\n",

      "Abstract: Genetic Algorithms are used to learn navigation and collision avoidance behaviors for robots. The learning is performed under simulation, and the resulting behaviors are then used to control the The approach to learning behaviors for robots described here reflects a particular methodology for learning via a simulation model. The motivation is that making mistakes on real systems may be costly or dangerous. In addition, time constraints might limit the number of experiences during learning in the real world, while in many cases, the simulation model can be made to run faster than real time. Since learning may require experimenting with behaviors that might occasionally produce unacceptable results if applied to the real world, or might require too much time in the real environment, we assume that hypothetical behaviors will be evaluated in a simulation model (the off-line system). As illustrated in Figure 1, the current best behavior can be placed in the real, on-line system, while learning continues in the off-line system [1]. The learning algorithm was designed to learn useful behaviors from simulations of limited fidelity. The expectation is that behaviors learned in these simulations will be useful in real-world environments. Previous studies have illustrated that knowledge learned under simulation is robust and might be applicable to the real world if the simulation is more general (i.e. has more noise, more varied conditions, etc.) than the real world environment [2]. Where this is not possible, it is important to identify the differences between the simulation and the world and note the effect upon the learning process. The research reported here continues to examine this hypothesis. The next section very briefly explains the learning algorithm (and gives pointers to where more extensive documentation can be found). After that, the actual robot is described. Then we describe the simulation of the robot. The task _______________ actual robot., \n",

The test and evaluation of complex software controllers is expected to be a challenging task. The goal of this e ffort is to apply machine learning techniques from the field of arti ficial intelligence to the general problem of evaluating an intelligent controller for an autonomous vehicle. The approach involves subjecting a controller to an adaptively chosen set of fault scenarios within a vehicle simulator, and searching for combinations of faults that produce noteworthy performance by the vehicle controller. The search employs a genetic algorithm. We illustrate the approach by evaluating the performance of a subsumption-based controller for an autonomous vehicle. The preliminary evidence suggests that this approach is an e ffective alternative to manual testing of sophisticated software controllers. \n",

      "Abstract: In many real-world domains the task of machine learning algorithms is to learn a theory predicting numerical values. In particular several standard test domains used in Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) are concerned with predicting numerical values from examples and relational and mostly non-determinate background knowledge. However, so far no ILP algorithm except one can predict numbers and cope with non-determinate background knowledge. (The only exception is a covering algorithm called FORS.) In this paper we present Structural Regression Trees (SRT), a new algorithm which can be applied to the above class of problems by integrating the statistical method of regression trees into ILP. SRT constructs a tree containing a literal (an atomic formula or its negation) or a conjunction of literals in each node, and assigns a numerical value to each leaf. SRT provides more comprehensible results than purely statistical methods, and can be applied to a class of problems most other ILP systems cannot handle. Experiments in several real-world domains demonstrate that the approach is competitive with existing methods, indicating that the advantages are not at the expense of predictive accuracy. , \n",

Then, they take a query, search the database for similar datapoints and build an on-line local model (such as a local average or local regression) with which to predict an output value. In this paper we review the advantages of instance based methods for autonomous systems, but we also note the ensuing cost: hopelessly slow computation as the database grows large. We present and evaluate a new way of structuring a database and a new algorithm for accessing it that maintains the advantages of instance-based learning. Earlier attempts to combat the cost of instance-based learning have sacrificed the explicit retention of all data, or been applicable only to instance-based predictions based on a small number of near neighbors or have had to re-introduce an explicit training phase in the form of an interpolative data structure. Our approach builds a multiresolution data structure to summarize the database of experiences at all resolutions of interest simultaneously.

The simplest inference task in DPNs is monitoring | that is, computing a posterior distribution for the state variables at each time step given all observations up to that time. Recursive, constant-space algorithms are well-known for monitoring in DPNs and other models. This paper is concerned with hindsight | that is, computing a posterior distribution given both past and future observations. Hindsight is an essential subtask of learning DPN models from data. Existing algorithms for hindsight in DPNs use O(SN ) space and time, where N is the total length of the observation sequence and S is the state space size for each time step. They are therefore impractical for hindsight in complex models with long observation sequences. This paper presents an O(S log N ) space, O(SN log N ) time hindsight algorithm. We demonstrates the effectiveness of the algorithm in two real-world DPN learning problems. We also discuss the possibility of an O(S)-space, O(SN )-time algorithm. \n",

Experimental data demonstrates cholinergic suppression of synaptic transmission in layer I (feedback synapses), and a lack of suppression in layer IV (feed-forward synapses). A network with this feature uses local rules to learn mappings which are not linearly separable. During learning, sensory stimuli and desired response are simultaneously presented as input. Feedforward connections form self-organized representations of input, while suppressed feedback connections learn the transpose of feedfor-ward connectivity. During recall, suppression is removed, sensory input activates the self-organized representation, and activity generates the learned response.\n",

The recognition taxonomy, i.e. the breakdown of each script into the tracks and roles, is extracted automatically and independently for each script from examples of script instantiations in an unsupervised self-organizing process. The process resembles human learning in that the differentiation of the most frequently encountered scripts become gradually the most detailed. The resulting structure is a hierachical pyramid of feature maps. The hierarchy visualizes the taxonomy and the maps lay out the topology of each level. The number of input lines and the self-organization time are considerably reduced compared to the ordinary single-level feature mapping. The system can recognize incomplete stories and recover the missing events. The taxonomy also serves as memory organization for script-based episodic memory. The maps assign a unique memory location for each script instantiation. The most salient parts of the input data are separated and most resources are concentrated on representing them accurately. , \n",

In a biologically more plausible implementation, similarity is measured by a scalar product, neighborhood is selected through lateral inhibition and weights are changed by redistributing synaptic resources. The resulting self-organizing process is quite similar to the abstract case. However, the process is somewhat hampered by boundary effects and the parameters need to be carefully evolved.

We show how complex information about external interventions can be organized and represented graphically and, conversely, how the graphical representation can be used to facilitate quantitative predictions of the effects of interventions. We first review the Markovian account of causation and show that directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) offer an economical scheme for representing conditional independence assumptions and for deducing and displaying all the logical consequences of such assumptions. We then introduce the manipulative account of causation and show that any DAG defines a simple transformation which tells us how the probability distribution will change as a result of external interventions in the system. Using this transformation it is possible to quantify, from non-experimental data, the effects of external interventions and to specify conditions under which randomized experiments are not necessary. Finally, the paper offers a graphical interpretation for Rubin's model of causal effects, and demonstrates its equivalence to the manipulative account of causation.

Given an imperfect theory, the approach combines explanation attempts for incorrectly classified examples in order to identify the failing portions of the theory. For each theory fault, correlated subsets of the examples are used to inductively generate a correction. Because the corrections are focused, they tend to preserve the structure of the original theory. Because the system starts with an approximate domain theory, in general fewer training examples are required to attain a given level of performance (classification accuracy) compared to a purely empirical system. The approach applies to classification systems employing a propositional Horn-clause theory.

      "Abstract: We have integrated the distributed search of genetic programming (GP) based systems with collective memory to form a collective adaptation search method. Such a system significantly improves search as problem complexity is increased. Since the pure GP approach does not scale well with problem complexity, a natural question is which of the two components is actually contributing to the search process. We investigate a collective memory search which utilizes a random search engine and find that it significantly outperforms the GP based search engine. We examine the solution space and show that as problem complexity and search space grow, a collective adaptive system will perform better than a collective memory search employing random search as an engine., \n",

Then, by using example-based learning techniques, we develop networks for performing analysis tasks such as pose and expression estimation, face recognition, and face detection in cluttered scenes.

       "Abstract: In time series problems, noise can be divided into two categories: dynamic noise which drives the process, and observational noise which is added in the measurement process, but does not influence future values of the system. In this framework, empirical volatilities (the squared relative returns of prices) exhibit a significant amount of observational noise. To model and predict their time evolution adequately, we estimate state space models that explicitly include observational noise. We obtain relaxation times for shocks in the logarithm of volatility ranging from three weeks (for foreign exchange) to three to five months (for stock indices). In most cases, a two-dimensional hidden state is required to yield residuals that are consistent with white noise. We compare these results with ordinary autoregressive models (without a hidden state) and find that autoregressive models underestimate the relaxation times by about two orders of magnitude due to their ignoring the distinction between observational and dynamic noise. This new interpretation of the dynamics of volatility in terms of relaxators in a state space model carries over to stochastic volatility models and to GARCH models, and is useful for several problems in finance, including risk management and the pricing of derivative securities.

This paper first introduces a simple principle for reducing the descriptions of event sequences without loss of information. A consequence of this principle is that only unexpected inputs can be relevant. This insight leads to the construction of neural architectures that learn to `divide and conquer' by recursively decomposing sequences. I describe two architectures. The first functions as a self-organizing multi-level hierarchy of recurrent networks. The second, involving only two recurrent networks, tries to collapse a multi-level predictor hierarchy into a single recurrent net.

Bottom-up segmentation heuristics often fail when neighboring digits overlap substantially. We describe a system that has a stochastic generative model of each digit class and we show that this is the only knowledge required for segmentation. The system uses Gibbs sampling to construct a perceptual interpretation of a digit string and segmentation arises naturally from the \"explaining away\" effects that occur during Bayesian inference. By using conditional mixtures of factor analyzers, it is possible to extract an explicit, compact representation of the instantiation parameters that describe the pose of each digit. These instantiation parameters can then be used as the inputs to a higher level system that models the relationships between digits. The same technique could be used to model individual digits as redundancies between the instantiation parameters of their parts.  \n",

Previous work in the area includes using sophisticated information exchange protocols, investigating heuristics for negotiation, and developing formal models of possibilities of conflict and cooperation among agent interests. In order to handle the changing requirements of continuous and dynamic environments, we propose learning as a means to provide additional possibilities for effective coordination. We use reinforcement learning techniques on a block pushing problem to show that agents can learn complimentary policies to follow a desired path without any knowledge about each other. We theoretically analyze and experimentally verify the effects of learning rate on system convergence, and demonstrate benefits of using learned coordination knowledge on similar problems. Reinforcement learning based coordination can be achieved in both cooperative and non-cooperative domains, and in domains with noisy communication channels and other stochastic characteristics that present a formidable challenge to using other coordination schemes.

Incremental evolution is an approach through which a dynamic evaluation function is scaled over time in order to improve the performance of evolutionary optimization.

Using two domains, a two-agent pursuit-evasion game and the Tracker [6] trail-following task, we demonstrate that incremental evolution is most successful when applied near the beginning of an evolutionary run.

We suggest that in many cases where stability has previously been assumed, the constant utility non-stationary environment may in fact be a more powerful viewpoint."

Currently the most important application of these methods is to temporal credit assignment in reinforcement learning. Well known reinforcement learning algorithms, such as AHC or Q-learning, may be viewed as instances of TD learning. This paper examines the issues of the efficient and general implementation of TD() for arbitrary , for use with reinforcement learning algorithms optimizing the discounted sum of rewards. The traditional approach, based on eligibility traces, is argued to suffer from both inefficiency and lack of generality. The TTD (Truncated Temporal Differences) procedure is proposed as an alternative, that indeed only approximates TD(), but requires very little computation per action and can be used with arbitrary function representation methods. The idea from which it is derived is fairly simple and not new, but probably unexplored so far. Encouraging experimental results are presented, suggesting that using &gt; 0 with the TTD procedure allows one to obtain a significant learning speedup at essentially the same cost as usual TD(0) learning."

Algorithms have been developed for making optimal decisions in mdps given either an mdp specification or the opportunity to interact with the mdp over time. Recently, other sequential decision-making problems have been studied prompting the development of new algorithms and analyses. We describe a new generalized model that subsumes mdps as well as many of the recent variations. We prove some basic results concerning this model and develop generalizations of value iteration, policy iteration, model-based reinforcement-learning, and Q-learning that can be used to make optimal decisions in the generalized model under various assumptions. Applications of the theory to particular models are described, including risk-averse mdps, exploration-sensitive mdps, sarsa, Q-learning with spreading, two-player games, and approximate max picking via sampling. Central to the results are the contraction property of the value operator and a stochastic-approximation theorem that reduces asynchronous convergence to synchronous convergence.   \n",

       "Abstract: It is open as to which chromosomal dimension performs best. Although higher-dimensional encodings (whether real or imaginary) can preserve more geographical gene linkages, we suspect that too high a dimension would not perform desirably. We are studying the question of which dimension of encoding is best for a given instance. It is likely that the optimal dimension is somehow dependent on the chromosome size and the input graph topology; interactions with the flexibility of crossover are yet unknown. The interaction of these considerations with the number of cuts used in the crossover is also an open issue. * In relocating genes onto a multi-dimensional chromosome, the simplest way is via a sequential assignment such as row-major order. Section 4 showed that performance improves when a DFS-row-major reembedding is used for two- and three-dimensional encodings. We suspect that this phenomenon will be consistent for higher-dimensional cases, and hope to perform more detailed investigations in the future. Although DFS reordering proved to be helpful for both linear encodings [19] and multi-dimensional encodings, we do not believe DFS-row-major reembedding is a good approach for the multi-dimensional cases since the row-major embedding is so simplistic. We are considering alternative 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional reembeddings which will hopefully provide further improvement. [4] T. N. Bui and B. R. Moon.

       "Abstract: Although connectionist learning procedures have been applied successfully to a variety of real-world scenarios, artificial neural networks have often been criticized for exhibiting a low degree of comprehensibility. Mechanisms that automatically compile neural networks into symbolic rules offer a promising perspective to overcome this practical shortcoming of neural network representations. This paper describes an approach to neural network rule extraction based on Validity Interval Analysis (VI-Analysis). VI-Analysis is a generic tool for extracting symbolic knowledge from Backpropagation-style artificial neural networks. It does this by propagating whole intervals of activations through the network in both the forward and backward directions. In the context of rule extraction, these intervals are used to prove or disprove the correctness of conjectured rules. We describe techniques for generating and testing rule hypotheses, and demonstrate these using some simple classification tasks including the MONK's benchmark problems. Rules extracted by VI-Analysis are provably correct. No assumptions are made about the topology of the network at hand, as well as the procedure employed for training the network. "

In the linear combination scheme, soft competition on different feature sets is adopted as an automatic feature rank mechanism so that different feature sets can be always simultaneously used in an optimal way to determine linear combination weights. For training the linear combination scheme, a learning algorithm is developed based on Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.

       "Abstract: Most of KDD applications consider databases as static objects, and however many databases are inherently temporal, i.e., they store the evolution of each object with the passage of time. Thus, regularities about the dynamics of these databases cannot be discovered as the current state might depend in some way on the previous states. To this end, a pre-processing of data is needed aimed at extracting relationships intimately connected to the temporal nature of data that will be make available to the discovery algorithm. The predicate logic language of ILP methods together with the recent advances as to ef ficiency makes them adequate for this task.  \n",

Herrmann, Research Report 580, Univ.Dortmund, 1995. Abstract The task of discovering interesting regularities in (large) sets of data (data mining, knowledge discovery) has recently met with increased interest in Machine Learning in general and in Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) in particular. However, while there is a widely accepted definition for the task of concept learning from examples in ILP, definitions for the data mining task have been proposed only recently. In this paper, we examine these so-called \"non-monotonic semantics\" definitions and show that non-monotonicity is only an incidental property of the data mining learning task, and that this task makes perfect sense without such an assumption. We therefore introduce and define a generalized definition of the data mining task called the ILP description learning problem and discuss its properties and relation to the traditional concept learning (prediction) learning problem. Since our characterization is entirely on the level of models, the definition applies independently of the chosen hypothesis language."

       "**Source:** Title: Regularization Theory and Neural Networks Architectures  \n",
       "Abstract: We had previously shown that regularization principles lead to approximation schemes which are equivalent to networks with one layer of hidden units, called Regularization Networks. In particular, standard smoothness functionals lead to a subclass of regularization networks, the well known Radial Basis Functions approximation schemes. This paper shows that regularization networks encompass a much broader range of approximation schemes, including many of the popular general additive models and some of the neural networks. In particular, we introduce new classes of smoothness functionals that lead to different classes of basis functions. Additive splines as well as some tensor product splines can be obtained from appropriate classes of smoothness functionals. Furthermore, the same generalization that extends Radial Basis Functions (RBF) to Hyper Basis Functions (HBF) also leads from additive models to ridge approximation models, containing as special cases Breiman's hinge functions, some forms of Projection Pursuit Regression and several types of neural networks. We propose to use the term Generalized Regularization Networks for this broad class of approximation schemes that follow from an extension of regularization. In the probabilistic interpretation of regularization, the different classes of basis functions correspond to different classes of prior probabilities on the approximating function spaces, and therefore to different types of smoothness assumptions. In summary, different multilayer networks with one hidden layer, which we collectively call Generalized Regularization Networks, correspond to different classes of priors and associated smoothness functionals in a classical regularization principle. Three broad classes are a) Radial Basis Functions that can be generalized to Hyper Basis Functions, b) some tensor product splines, and c) additive splines that can be generalized to schemes of the type of ridge approximation, hinge functions and several perceptron-like neural networks with one-hidden layer. 1 This paper will appear on Neural Computation, vol. 7, pages 219-269, 1995.

       "**Target:** Title: State Reconstruction for Determining Predictability in Driven Nonlinear Acoustical Systems  \n",
       "Abstract: Genetic programming is distinguished from other evolutionary algorithms in that it uses tree representations of variable size instead of linear strings of fixed length. The flexible representation scheme is very important because it allows the underlying structure of the data to be discovered automatically. One primary difficulty, however, is that the solutions may grow too big without any improvement of their generalization ability. In this paper we investigate the fundamental relationship between the performance and complexity of the evolved structures. The essence of the parsimony problem is demonstrated empirically by analyzing error landscapes of programs evolved for neural network synthesis. We consider genetic programming as a statistical inference problem and apply the Bayesian model-comparison framework to introduce a class of fitness functions with error and complexity terms. An adaptive learning method is then presented that automatically balances the model-complexity factor to evolve parsimonious programs without losing the diversity of the population needed for achieving the desired training accuracy. The effectiveness of this approach is empirically shown on the induction of sigma-pi neural networks for solving a real-world medical diagnosis problem as well as benchmark tasks. "

       "**Target:** Title: Accounting for Model Uncertainty in Survival Analysis Improves Predictive Performance  \n",
       "Abstract: Survival analysis is concerned with finding models to predict the survival of patients or to assess the efficacy of a clinical treatment. A key part of the model-building process is the selection of the predictor variables. It is standard to use a stepwise procedure guided by a series of significance tests to select a single model, and then to make inference conditionally on the selected model. However, this ignores model uncertainty, which can be substantial. We review the standard Bayesian model averaging solution to this problem and extend it to survival analysis, introducing partial Bayes factors to do so for the Cox proportional hazards model. In two examples, taking account of model uncertainty enhances predictive performance, to an extent that could be clinically useful."

       "Abstract: Genetic Algorithms are used to learn navigation and collision avoidance behaviors for robots. The learning is performed under simulation, and the resulting behaviors are then used to control the The approach to learning behaviors for robots described here reflects a particular methodology for learning via a simulation model. The motivation is that making mistakes on real systems may be costly or dangerous. In addition, time constraints might limit the number of experiences during learning in the real world, while in many cases, the simulation model can be made to run faster than real time. Since learning may require experimenting with behaviors that might occasionally produce unacceptable results if applied to the real world, or might require too much time in the real environment, we assume that hypothetical behaviors will be evaluated in a simulation model (the off-line system). As illustrated in Figure 1, the current best behavior can be placed in the real, on-line system, while learning continues in the off-line system [1]. The learning algorithm was designed to learn useful behaviors from simulations of limited fidelity. The expectation is that behaviors learned in these simulations will be useful in real-world environments. Previous studies have illustrated that knowledge learned under simulation is robust and might be applicable to the real world if the simulation is more general (i.e. has more noise, more varied conditions, etc.) than the real world environment [2]. Where this is not possible, it is important to identify the differences between the simulation and the world and note the effect upon the learning process. The research reported here continues to examine this hypothesis. The next section very briefly explains the learning algorithm (and gives pointers to where more extensive documentation can be found). After that, the actual robot is described. Then we describe the simulation of the robot. The task _______________ actual robot.  \n",

This includes two-team dynamic tasks, and this paper concentrates on simulated soccer as an example. Bayesian networks are used to characterize action selection whereas a case-based approach is used to determine how to implement actions. This paper has two contributions. First, we survey integrations of case-based and Bayesian approaches from the perspective of a popular CBR task decomposition framework, thus explaining what types of integrations have been attempted. This allows us to explain the unique aspects of our proposed integration. Second, we demonstrate how Bayesian nets can be used to provide environmental context, and thus feature selection information, for the case-based reasoner."

The test and evaluation of complex software controllers is expected to be a challenging task. The goal of this e ffort is to apply machine learning techniques from the field of arti ficial intelligence to the general problem of evaluating an intelligent controller for an autonomous vehicle. The approach involves subjecting a controller to an adaptively chosen set of fault scenarios within a vehicle simulator, and searching for combinations of faults that produce noteworthy performance by the vehicle controller. The search employs a genetic algorithm. We illustrate the approach by evaluating the performance of a subsumption-based controller for an autonomous vehicle. The preliminary evidence suggests that this approach is an e ffective alternative to manual testing of sophisticated software controllers. "

       "**Source:** Title: Structural Regression Trees  \n",
       "Abstract: In many real-world domains the task of machine learning algorithms is to learn a theory predicting numerical values. In particular several standard test domains used in Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) are concerned with predicting numerical values from examples and relational and mostly non-determinate background knowledge. However, so far no ILP algorithm except one can predict numbers and cope with non-determinate background knowledge. (The only exception is a covering algorithm called FORS.) In this paper we present Structural Regression Trees (SRT), a new algorithm which can be applied to the above class of problems by integrating the statistical method of regression trees into ILP. SRT constructs a tree containing a literal (an atomic formula or its negation) or a conjunction of literals in each node, and assigns a numerical value to each leaf. SRT provides more comprehensible results than purely statistical methods, and can be applied to a class of problems most other ILP systems cannot handle. Experiments in several real-world domains demonstrate that the approach is competitive with existing methods, indicating that the advantages are not at the expense of predictive accuracy.   \n",

The results show that simple patterns and rules are often not only more understandable, but also more reliable than complex rules. Simple decision trees are able to improve the chances of correctly predicting the outcome of a conflict management attempt. This suggests that mediation is more repetitive than conflicts per se, where such results have not been achieved so far. "

However, by taking into account the interacting effects of population size and crossover, a general picture begins to emerge. The implications of these results on implementation issues and performance are discussed, and several directions for further research are suggested. "

       "Abstract: Instance-based learning methods explicitly remember all the data that they receive. They usually have no training phase, and only at prediction time do they perform computation. Then, they take a query, search the database for similar datapoints and build an on-line local model (such as a local average or local regression) with which to predict an output value. In this paper we review the advantages of instance based methods for autonomous systems, but we also note the ensuing cost: hopelessly slow computation as the database grows large. We present and evaluate a new way of structuring a database and a new algorithm for accessing it that maintains the advantages of instance-based learning. Earlier attempts to combat the cost of instance-based learning have sacrificed the explicit retention of all data, or been applicable only to instance-based predictions based on a small number of near neighbors or have had to re-introduce an explicit training phase in the form of an interpolative data structure. Our approach builds a multiresolution data structure to summarize the database of experiences at all resolutions of interest simultaneously. This permits us to query the database with the same exibility as a conventional linear search, but at greatly reduced computational cost.  \n",

Existing algorithms for hindsight in DPNs use O(SN ) space and time, where N is the total length of the observation sequence and S is the state space size for each time step. They are therefore impractical for hindsight in complex models with long observation sequences. This paper presents an O(S log N ) space, O(SN log N ) time hindsight algorithm. We demonstrates the effectiveness of the algorithm in two real-world DPN learning problems. We also discuss the possibility of an O(S)-space, O(SN )-time algorithm. "

       "Abstract: Selective suppression of transmission at feedback synapses during learning is proposed as a mechanism for combining associative feedback with self-organization of feedforward synapses. Experimental data demonstrates cholinergic suppression of synaptic transmission in layer I (feedback synapses), and a lack of suppression in layer IV (feed-forward synapses). A network with this feature uses local rules to learn mappings which are not linearly separable. During learning, sensory stimuli and desired response are simultaneously presented as input. Feedforward connections form self-organized representations of input, while suppressed feedback connections learn the transpose of feedfor-ward connectivity. During recall, suppression is removed, sensory input activates the self-organized representation, and activity generates the learned response."

       "Abstract: The hierarchical feature map system recognizes an input story as an instance of a particular script by classifying it at three levels: scripts, tracks and role bindings. The recognition taxonomy, i.e. the breakdown of each script into the tracks and roles, is extracted automatically and independently for each script from examples of script instantiations in an unsupervised self-organizing process. The process resembles human learning in that the differentiation of the most frequently encountered scripts become gradually the most detailed. The resulting structure is a hierachical pyramid of feature maps. The hierarchy visualizes the taxonomy and the maps lay out the topology of each level. The number of input lines and the self-organization time are considerably reduced compared to the ordinary single-level feature mapping. The system can recognize incomplete stories and recover the missing events. The taxonomy also serves as memory organization for script-based episodic memory. The maps assign a unique memory location for each script instantiation. The most salient parts of the input data are separated and most resources are concentrated on representing them accurately.   \n",

       "Abstract: Self-organizing feature maps are usually implemented by abstracting the low-level neural and parallel distributed processes. An external supervisor finds the unit whose weight vector is closest in Euclidian distance to the input vector and determines the neighborhood for weight adaptation. The weights are changed proportional to the Euclidian distance. In a biologically more plausible implementation, similarity is measured by a scalar product, neighborhood is selected through lateral inhibition and weights are changed by redistributing synaptic resources. The resulting self-organizing process is quite similar to the abstract case. However, the process is somewhat hampered by boundary effects and the parameters need to be carefully evolved. It is also necessary to add a redundant dimension to the input vectors."

Each level can contain an arbitrary number of rules \"if c then l\" where l is the class associated to the level and c is a concept from a given class of basic concepts. The rules of higher levels have precedence over the rules of lower levels and can be used to represent exceptions. As basic concepts we can use Boolean attributes in the infinite attribute space model, or certain concepts defined in terms of substrings. Given a sample of m examples, the algorithm runs in polynomial time and produces a consistent concept representation of size O((log m) k n k ), where n is the size of the smallest consistent representation with k levels of rules. This implies that the algorithm learns in the PAC model. The algorithm repeatedly applies the greedy heuristics for weighted set cover. The weights are obtained from approximate solutions to previous set cover problems.  \n",

Furthermore, we have discovered that under some conditions the proposed neural network models with associated learning algorithms exhibit a random switch of attention, i.e. they have ability of chaotic or random switching or cross-over of output signals in such way that a specified separated signal may appear at various outputs at different time windows. Validity, performance and dynamic properties of the proposed learning algorithms are investigated by computer simulation experiments.   \n",

In order to be able to combine these knowledge bases of different formats, we need to first establish a common basis for characterizing and evaluating the different formalisms, and provide a semantics for the combined mechanism. A common framework can provide an infrastructure for building an integrated system, and is essential if we are to understand its behavior. We present a unifying framework based on an ordered partition of possible worlds called partition sequences, which corresponds to our intuitive notion of biasing towards certain possible scenarios when we are uncertain of the actual situation. We show that some of the existing formalisms, namely, default logic, autoepistemic logic, probabilistic conditioning and thresholding (generalized conditioning), and possibility theory can be incorporated into this general framework."

       "Abstract: This paper demonstrates the use of graphs as a mathematical tool for expressing independenices, and as a formal language for communicating and processing causal information in statistical analysis. We show how complex information about external interventions can be organized and represented graphically and, conversely, how the graphical representation can be used to facilitate quantitative predictions of the effects of interventions. We first review the Markovian account of causation and show that directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) offer an economical scheme for representing conditional independence assumptions and for deducing and displaying all the logical consequences of such assumptions. We then introduce the manipulative account of causation and show that any DAG defines a simple transformation which tells us how the probability distribution will change as a result of external interventions in the system. Using this transformation it is possible to quantify, from non-experimental data, the effects of external interventions and to specify conditions under which randomized experiments are not necessary. Finally, the paper offers a graphical interpretation for Rubin's model of causal effects, and demonstrates its equivalence to the manipulative account of causation. We exemplify the tradeoffs between the two approaches by deriving nonparametric bounds on treatment effects under conditions of imperfect compliance.   \n",

We then analyze the convergence of EM in terms of special properties of P and provide new results analyzing the effect that P has on the likelihood surface.

       "Abstract: This article describes a comprehensive approach to automatic theory revision. Given an imperfect theory, the approach combines explanation attempts for incorrectly classified examples in order to identify the failing portions of the theory. For each theory fault, correlated subsets of the examples are used to inductively generate a correction. Because the corrections are focused, they tend to preserve the structure of the original theory. Because the system starts with an approximate domain theory, in general fewer training examples are required to attain a given level of performance (classification accuracy) compared to a purely empirical system. The approach applies to classification systems employing a propositional Horn-clause theory. The system has been tested in a variety of application domains, and results are presented for problems in the domains of molecular biology and plant disease diagnosis.   \n",

Data analysts typically select a model from some class of models and then proceed as if the selected model had generated the data. This approach ignores the uncertainty in model selection, leading to over-confident inferences and decisions that are more risky than one thinks they are. Bayesian model averaging (BMA) provides a coherent mechanism for accounting for this model uncertainty. Several methods for implementing BMA have recently emerged. We discuss these methods and present a number of examples. In these examples, BMA provides improved out-of-sample predictive performance.

We investigate a collective memory search which utilizes a random search engine and find that it significantly outperforms the GP based search engine. We examine the solution space and show that as problem complexity and search space grow, a collective adaptive system will perform better than a collective memory search employing random search as an engine.  \n",

       "**Source:** Title: The megaprior heuristic for discovering protein sequence patterns  \n",
       "Abstract: Several computer algorithms for discovering patterns in groups of protein sequences are in use that are based on fitting the parameters of a statistical model to a group of related sequences. These include hidden Markov model (HMM) algorithms for multiple sequence alignment, and the MEME and Gibbs sampler algorithms for discovering motifs. These algorithms are sometimes prone to producing models that are incorrect because two or more patterns have been combined. The statistical model produced in this situation is a convex combination (weighted average) of two or more different models. This paper presents a solution to the problem of convex combinations in the form of a heuristic based on using extremely low variance Dirichlet mixture priors as part of the statistical model. This heuristic, which we call the megaprior heuristic, increases the strength (i.e., decreases the variance) of the prior in proportion to the size of the sequence dataset. This causes each column in the final model to strongly resemble the mean of a single component of the prior, regardless of the size of the dataset. We describe the cause of the convex combination problem, analyze it mathematically, motivate and describe the implementation of the megaprior heuristic, and show how it can effectively eliminate the problem of convex combinations in protein sequence pattern discovery.   \n",

       "Abstract: To implement a specific application, you should only have to change the file app.c. Section 2 describes the routines in app.c in detail. If you use additional variables for your specific problem, the easiest method of making them available to other program units is to declare them in sga.h and external.h. However, take care that you do not redeclare existing variables. Two example applications files are included in the SGA-C distribution. The file app1.c performs the simple example problem included with the Pascal version; finding the maximum of x 10 , where x is an integer interpretation of a chromosome. A slightly more complex application is include in app2.c. This application illustrates two features that have been added to SGA-C. The first of these is the ithruj2int function, which converts bits i through j in a chromosome to an integer. The second new feature is the utility pointer that is associated with each population member. The example application interprets each chromosome as a set of concatenated integers in binary form. The lengths of these integer fields is determined by the user-specified value of field size, which is read in by the function app data(). The field size must be less than the smallest of the chromosome length and the length of an unsigned integer. An integer array for storing the interpreted form of each chromosome is dynamically allocated and assigned to the chromosome's utility pointer in app malloc(). The ithruj2int routine (see utility.c) is used to translate each chromosome into its associated vector. The fitness for each chromosome is simply the sum of the squares of these integers. This example application will function for any chromosome length. SGA-C is intended to be a simple program for first-time GA experimentation. It is not intended to be definitive in terms of its efficiency or the grace of its implementation. The authors are interested in the comments, criticisms, and bug reports from SGA-C users, so that the code can be refined for easier use in subsequent versions.

The goal of the learning algorithm is to induce a compact rule set describing the basic dependencies within a set of data. The reduction is based on criterion which is very exible and gives a semantic interpretation of the rules which fulfill the criteria. Comparison with syntactical hypotheses reduction show that the a reduction improves search and has a smaller probability of missclassification.   \n",

       "**Source:** Title: Context-sensitive attribute estimation in regression  \n",
       "Abstract: One of key issues in both discrete and continuous class prediction and in machine learning in general seems to be the problem of estimating the quality of attributes. Heuristic measures mostly assume independence of attributes so their use is non-optimal in domains with strong dependencies between attributes. For the same reason they are also mostly unable to recognize context dependent features. Relief and its extension Re-liefF are statistical methods capable of correctly estimating the quality of attributes in classification problems with strong dependencies between attributes. By exploiting local information provided by different contexts they provide a global view and recognize contextual attributes. After the analysis of ReliefF we have extended it to continuous class problems. Regressional ReliefF (RReliefF) and ReliefF provide a unified view on estimating attribute quality. The experiments show that RReliefF correctly estimates the quality of attributes, recognizes the contextual attributes and can be used for non myopic learning of the regression trees.  \n",
       "**Target:** Title: Feature Selection via Mathematical Programming  \n",
       "Abstract: The problem of discriminating between two finite point sets in n-dimensional feature space by a separating plane that utilizes as few of the features as possible, is formulated as a mathematical program with a parametric objective function and linear constraints. The step function that appears in the objective function can be approximated by a sigmoid or by a concave exponential on the nonnegative real line, or it can be treated exactly by considering the equivalent linear program with equilibrium constraints (LPEC). Computational tests of these three approaches on publicly available real-world databases have been carried out and compared with an adaptation of the optimal brain damage (OBD) method for reducing neural network complexity. One feature selection algorithm via concave minimization (FSV) reduced cross-validation error on a cancer prognosis database by 35.4% while reducing problem features from 32 to 4. Feature selection is an important problem in machine learning [18, 15, 16, 17, 33]. In its basic form the problem consists of eliminating as many of the features in a given problem as possible, while still carrying out a preassigned task with acceptable accuracy. Having a minimal number of features often leads to better generalization and simpler models that can be more easily interpreted. In the present work, our task is to discriminate between two given sets in an n-dimensional feature space by using as few of the given features as possible. We shall formulate this problem as a mathematical program with a parametric objective function that will attempt to achieve this task by generating a separating plane in a feature space of as small a dimension as possible while minimizing the average distance of misclassified points to the plane. One of the computational experiments that we carried out on our feature selection procedure showed its effectiveness, not only in minimizing the number of features selected, but also in quickly recognizing and removing spurious random features that were introduced. Thus, on the Wisconsin Prognosis Breast Cancer WPBC database [36] with a feature space of 32 dimensions and 6 random features added, one of our algorithms FSV (11) immediately removed the 6 random features as well as 28 of the original features resulting in a separating plane in a 4-dimensional reduced feature space. By using tenfold cross-validation [35], separation error in the 4-dimensional space was reduced 35.4% from the corresponding error in the original problem space. (See Section 3 for details.) We note that mathematical programming approaches to the feature selection problem have been recently proposed in [4, 22]. Even though the approach of [4] is based on an LPEC formulation, both the LPEC and its method of solution are different from the ones used here. The polyhedral concave minimization approach of [22] is principally involved with theoretical considerations of one specific algorithm and no cross-validatory results are given. Other effective computational applications of mathematical programming to neural networks are given in [30, 26]. "

       "Abstract: Holland's Schema Theorem is widely taken to be the foundation for explanations of the power of genetic algorithms (GAs). Yet some dissent has been expressed as to its implications. Here, dissenting arguments are reviewed and elaborated upon, explaining why the Schema Theorem has no implications for how well a GA is performing. Interpretations of the Schema Theorem have implicitly assumed that a correlation exists between parent and offspring fitnesses, and this assumption is made explicit in results based on Price's Covariance and Selection Theorem. Schemata do not play a part in the performance theorems derived for representations and operators in general. However, schemata re-emerge when recombination operators are used. Using Geiringer's recombination distribution representation of recombination operators, a \"missing\" schema theorem is derived which makes explicit the intuition for when a GA should perform well. Finally, the method of \"adaptive landscape\" analysis is examined and counterexamples offered to the commonly used correlation statistic. Instead, an alternative statistic | the transmission function in the fitness domain | is proposed as the optimal statistic for estimating GA performance from limited samples."

       "Abstract: Infusion of a GABA agonist (Reiter & Stryker, 1988) and infusion of an NMDA receptor antagonist (Bear et al., 1990), in the primary visual cortex of kittens during monocular deprivation, shifts ocular dominance toward the closed eye, in the cortical region near the infusion site. This reverse ocular dominance shift has been previously modeled by variants of a covariance synaptic plasticity rule (Bear et al., 1990; Clothiaux et al., 1991; Miller et al., 1989; Reiter & Stryker, 1988). Kasamatsu et al. (1997, 1998) showed that infusion of an NMDA receptor antagonist in adult cat primary visual cortex changes ocular dominance distribution, reduces binocularity, and reduces orientation and direction selectivity. This paper presents a novel account of the effects of these pharmacological treatments, based on the EXIN synaptic plasticity rules (Marshall, 1995), which include both an instar afferent excitatory and an outstar lateral inhibitory rule. Functionally, the EXIN plasticity rules enhance the efficiency, discrimination, and context-sensitivity of a neural network's representation of perceptual patterns (Marshall, 1995; Marshall & Gupta, 1998). The EXIN model decreases lateral inhibition from neurons outside the infusion site (control regions) to neurons inside the infusion region, during monocular deprivation. In the model, plasticity in afferent pathways to neurons affected by the pharmacological treatments is assumed to be blocked , as opposed to previous models (Bear et al., 1990; Miller et al., 1989; Reiter & Stryker, 1988), in which afferent pathways from the open eye to neurons in the infusion region are weakened . The proposed model is consistent with results suggesting that long-term plasticity can be blocked by NMDA antagonists or by postsynaptic hyperpolarization (Bear et al., 1990; Dudek & Bear, 1992; Goda & Stevens, 1996; Kirkwood et al., 1993). Since the role of plasticity in lateral inhibitory pathways in producing cortical plasticity has not received much attention, several predictions are made based on the EXIN lateral inhibitory plasticity rule.   \n",

Since the role of plasticity in lateral inhibitory pathways in producing cortical plasticity has not received much attention, several predictions are made based on the EXIN lateral inhibitory plasticity rule.

       "Abstract: Although feedforward neural networks are well suited to function approximation, in some applications networks experience problems when learning a desired function. One problem is interference which occurs when learning in one area of the input space causes unlearning in another area. Networks that are less susceptible to interference are referred to as spatially local networks. To understand these properties, a theoretical framework, consisting of a measure of interference and a measure of network localization, is developed that incorporates not only the network weights and architecture but also the learning algorithm. Using this framework to analyze sigmoidal multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks that employ the back-prop learning algorithm, we address a familiar misconception that sigmoidal networks are inherently non-local by demonstrating that given a sufficiently large number of adjustable parameters, sigmoidal MLPs can be made arbitrarily local while retaining the ability to represent any continuous function on a compact domain.   \n",

       "Abstract: In this paper we are concerned with the problem of acquiring knowledge by integration. Our aim is to construct an integrated knowledge base from several separate sources. The need to merge knowledge bases can arise, for example, when knowledge bases are acquired independently from interactions with several domain experts. As opinions of different domain experts may differ, the knowledge bases constructed in this way will normally differ too. A similar problem can also arise whenever separate knowledge bases are generated by learning algorithms. The objective of integration is to construct one system that exploits all the knowledge that is available and has a good performance. The aim of this paper is to discuss the methodology of knowledge integration, describe the implemented system (INTEG.3), and present some concrete results which demonstrate the advantages of this method.   \n",

The statistical model underlying the architecture is a hierarchical mixture model in which both the mixture coefficients and the mixture components are generalized linear models (GLIM's). Learning is treated as a maximum likelihood problem; in particular, we present an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for adjusting the parameters of the architecture. We also develop an on-line learning algorithm in which the parameters are updated incrementally. Comparative simulation results are presented in the robot dynamics domain.
